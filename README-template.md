### What I learned


1.Adding Box Shadow Effect on Main Container Click:

```css
main:active {       
    color: rgb(5, 3, 0);
    opacity: 1;
    box-shadow: 15px 17px 0px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.75);    
}
```

2.Implementing Responsive Behavior for Mobile Devices:
```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    main {}
}
```

3.Adjusting Main Container Size for Mobile Devices using calc() Function:
```css
width: calc(100% - 40px);
```

4.Utilizing box-sizing Property to Include Padding and Borders:
```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    main {}
}
	box-sizing: border-box; 
```

5.Constraining Image Size to Fit Container:
```css
.code-pic {
        max-width: 85.5%; 
        min-width: 301px;
}
```

6.Ensuring the image's responsiveness by allowing its height to adjust automatically:
```css
.code-pic {
height: auto;
}
```

7.Media Queries for Font Size Adjustment:
```css
.text-1, .date {
        font-size: 13.5px;
}
```

8.Aligning Text Near Profile Using Relative Positioning:
```css
.person-name {
    position: relative;
    left: 48px;
    bottom: 47px;
    margin-right: 76px;
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This resource proved valuable to me when I had to search for specific HTML or CSS elements for my project. I highly recommend this site to anyone looking to initiate their learning journey in HTML and CSS. It also offers a comprehensive set of learning materials tailored for novice developers and students.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is additionally valuable for refining coding skills, and the "try me" section is beneficial if you wish to observe the code in action.

- [Example resource 3](https://www.sitepoint.com/) - Good to find a range of resources including articles, tutorials, books, and online courses covering various topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, UX/UI design, and more.

- [Example resource 4](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow/) - Helpful for experimenting and generating CSS styles such as border radius, box shadow, and more.
